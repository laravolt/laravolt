## 2024-05-11 - Optimized Permission Check
**Learning:** Laravolt's `HasRoleAndPermission` and `Role` models do dynamic query checks or `contains` lookups when `hasPermission` is called. Since permissions are eager-loaded, doing a `contains` operation manually can bypass `app(config(...))` overhead and Model instantiation.
**Action:** Overrode `_hasPermission` in models to utilize eager-loaded relations properly.

## 2024-05-22 - Extracted Schema checks from loops
**Learning:** Calling `Schema::hasTable` or `Schema::hasColumn` inside a loop executes a new database query to the information schema for every iteration, causing a hidden N+1 bottleneck.
**Action:** Extract Schema checks outside of loops or batch the underlying operations so that the Schema check is only performed once.
